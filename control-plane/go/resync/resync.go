// Package resync is the periodic full sweep — what actually guarantees the edge converges.
//
// RunOnce runs once at boot (so a cold start doesn't wait for the first change event before the
// edge has any config at all) and then on a timer via RunLoop. It is deliberately the SIMPLE
// path: read every zone, recompile, publish, and delete anything published that no longer
// belongs. No diffing against what was published before — republishing an unchanged zone writes
// the same bytes, and the cost of a wrong diff is a zone silently serving stale rules.
//
// This is also the only thing that removes a zone whose delete event went missing: the index in
// Redis is compared against the set of hostnames data-plane currently says should be served.
