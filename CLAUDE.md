# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this repo is

`metap-demo-waf` is a demo **WAAP** (Web Application & API Protection, Cloudflare-style) product.
**All three planes have code now** (2026-09-04) — `data-plane/` (3 pillar services + GraphQL
gateway config + Customer Portal frontend), `control-plane/` (`waf-config-distributor`), and
`edge-plane/` (`waf-edge`, the mitigation engine). See the plane table below. **All 3 Rust
workspaces build/clippy/test clean and `data-plane/web` passes `tsc`/`oxlint`/`prettier`/`vite
build`, and `data-plane`'s own 3 e2e tests now pass against a real Postgres too** (verified
2026-09-04, same day, two separate passes — see Working conventions for exactly what each covered
and what still hasn't run: `control-plane`/`edge-plane` still have no live-infra e2e proof, and
nothing has yet shown a portal rule change actually reaching the edge). The product/architecture
spec lives in `data-plane/docs/` and remains the source of truth
for anything not yet built. Read
`data-plane/docs/01-product-vision.md` through `04-architecture-boundary.md` in order before
proposing or writing any code — they contain the settled decisions (scope, domain model, personas,
plane boundaries) that later work must stay consistent with. Docs are written in Vietnamese.

This repo is built on top of a sibling repo, `../metap` (a metadata-driven platform core: Rust/axum/
sqlx/PostgreSQL/RabbitMQ, outbox pattern, generic CRUD/workflow/permission engine). `metap-demo-waf`
is one product built on that platform, not a fork of it — `metap`'s own *code/build* conventions
(its Cargo workspace commands, crate layering, `CLAUDE.md`) live in that separate sibling repo and
don't apply here directly. That's different from the *operational* conventions in
`../CLAUDE.md` (root of `metap-org`) — respond in Vietnamese, never commit without being asked,
check `target/` size before a build session — which do apply here, same as every repo in this
directory, since this file doesn't override any of them. `metap`'s primitives
(`metap-metadata`, `metap-workflow`, `metap-cron`, `metap-permission`, `metap-cache`, `metap-grpc`,
`metap-reconciler`, `metap-storage`) are the ones `data-plane/` is meant to reuse rather than
reinvent.

## Repo structure: 3 planes, 3 deploy cycles

The repo is deliberately split into three top-level directories, each a separate codebase/deploy
cycle with a hard boundary — do not blur these when implementing:

| Directory | Role | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `data-plane/` | Business portal (source of truth): Zone, DDoS policy, firewall rule, vulnerability scan, incident, alert — built on `metap`, full CRUD/workflow/permission UI | 3 services (`zones`/`scanning`/`alerting`) + `waf-graphql-gateway` (own binary, `data-plane/graphql-gateway/`, not just config — 7 custom mutations, wraps `metap`'s generic gateway library via `build_with_extensions`) + Customer Portal frontend (10-module IA, zone-centric). Custom non-CRUD endpoints live in each service's `src/routes.rs`. **Both compose files must build/run `waf-graphql-gateway`, not `metap/crates/metap-graphql-gateway`'s generic binary** — found live, 2026-09-04: they'd been pointed at the generic one, silently dropping every custom field (`docs/roadmap/76-waf-portal-live-bugfixes.md`) |
| `control-plane/` | Headless worker: pulls config changes from `data-plane` (RabbitMQ outbox subscribe), compiles them into an edge-ready rule-set, writes to Redis/DragonflyDB. No UI, not CRUD | `waf-config-distributor` — 3 jobs in one process: subscribe (fast path), periodic full resync (**the convergence guarantee**), telemetry ingest. The Redis contract is `waf-config-distributor/src/ruleset.rs` |
| `edge-plane/` | High-performance, low-latency mitigation engine: evaluates rules against real traffic, blocks/challenges/logs. Deliberately **not** built on `metap`/metadata-driven approach | `waf-edge` — hyper 1.x, **zero `metap` dependency anywhere in the tree**. `ArcSwap` rule snapshot (a request never touches Redis), DDoS budget → priority-ordered rules → block/challenge/log → proxy to origin |

Key rule, stated repeatedly in the docs: **`edge-plane` never talks to `data-plane` directly.** It
only reads config that `control-plane` has already computed into Redis/DragonflyDB.

Data flow:
```
data-plane (Zone/DdosPolicy/FirewallRule change via portal)
  → metap outbox (same transaction as the DB write)
  → outbox-publisher → RabbitMQ
  → control-plane worker subscribes, compiles a per-Zone rule-set, writes to Redis/DragonflyDB
  → edge-plane reads Redis directly (low latency, many edge nodes share one key)
```
`Zone.configVersion` increments on every change to a zone's policies/rules; `control-plane` and
`edge-plane` both compare it to detect stale cache instead of guessing from timestamps.

Telemetry direction (`SecurityEvent`, edge → up) **was decided in Phase 72 (2026-09-04): option 2**
— the edge batches to `control-plane`, which writes into `data-plane` through the ordinary CRUD
route. That is the option `04-architecture-boundary.md` already leaned toward, and it keeps the
"edge never talks to `data-plane` directly" rule intact. It was decided in-session rather than by
the project owner, so it is flagged in `../metap-docs/docs/roadmap/72-control-edge-planes.md` and
in that PR, and is cheap to reverse (the edge knows exactly one ingest URL).

## Domain model (business-level, not yet `EntityDefinition` code)

`data-plane/docs/02-domain-model.md` has full field-level detail. Summary of the entity graph:

```
Tenant (reused from metap control.tenants)
  └─ Zone (protected site/domain; status: pending→active→paused→(active); terminal: suspended)
       ├─ DdosPolicy (0..1 active at a time)
       ├─ FirewallRule (0..N — shared rule engine for WAF custom rules/rate-limit/IP-geo firewall;
       │    ordered by priority, first match wins)
       ├─ ScanJob (0..N, schedule via metap-cron cron expression)
       │    └─ ScanFinding (0..N; remediationStatus workflow: open→confirmed→fixed / falsePositive / accepted)
       ├─ SecurityEvent (0..N — high volume, written by edge-plane)
       └─ Incident (0..N — correlates SecurityEvents; status: open→acknowledged→mitigating→resolved,
            a metap-workflow EntityWorkflow)
AlertPolicy (Tenant-scoped, watches N zones)
  └─ AlertNotification (delivery log, sent/failed)
```

**All 9 entities across the 3 `data-plane` services are on dedicated tables now** (2026-09-07,
`../metap-docs/docs/roadmap/79-lowcode-dynamic-table-per-entity-and-waf-migration.md`),
not just `SecurityEvent`. Each service's `main.rs` reconciles its own entities at boot
(`metap_reconciler::reconcile`, hand-ordered: `zones-service` — `waf.zones` before
`waf.ddos_policies`/`waf.firewall_rules`; `scanning-service` — `waf.scan_jobs` before
`waf.scan_findings`; `alerting-service` — `waf.alert_policies` before
`waf.alert_notifications`, `waf.security_events`/`waf.incidents` independent of everything). All
9 converge to `ops_applied: 0` on a second boot, confirmed live.

**This migration found and fixed 4 real bugs in `metap` core** (`crates/metap-reconciler`,
`crates/metap-crud`), all pre-existing and unrelated to this repo's own code, all newly exposed
because `waf.ddos_policies.zoneId`/`waf.zones.hostname` are the first `unique: true` fields
anywhere in this codebase's history to go through table-per-entity:

1. **Non-convergent reconcile.** `compile.rs` used to emit *two* redundant unique constructs for
   the same field (an `IndexSpec` unique index **and** a `UniqueSpec` table constraint), and
   separately `diff.rs`'s orphan-index cleanup didn't know a constraint's own backing index isn't
   an independently-droppable object — together these meant `ops_applied` never reached 0 for any
   `unique: true` real-column field.
2. **No soft-delete awareness.** The resulting blanket `UNIQUE` constraint had no notion of
   `deleted = false` — a soft-deleted row permanently occupied its unique value, so
   deleting-then-recreating a `DdosPolicy` for the same zone (a real portal action) was rejected
   with `unique_violation` against its own soft-deleted predecessor. Reported live by the user
   mid-session, from the actual portal.
3. **`searchable` silently dropped `unique`.** `compile()`'s `searchable` branch `continue`d
   unconditionally, skipping the unique-handling logic entirely for any field that was *also*
   `unique: true` — `waf.zones.hostname` (searchable + unique) lost its uniqueness enforcement
   completely the moment `waf.zones` moved to table-per-entity, even though it was enforced on the
   old shared `records` table. Found by auditing every `unique: true` field across
   `metap-demo-waf`/`metap-demo-jira`/`metap-demo-crm` after fixing #1/#2 (only WAF has any —
   `waf.ddos_policies.zoneId` and `waf.zones.hostname`; jira/crm's code-authored entities have
   none).
4. **`unique_violation`'s field-name extraction only worked for the shared `records` table.**
   `metap-crud`'s error mapper guessed the violated constraint's name from a single hardcoded
   prefix (`uniq_records_<entity>_`) — a dedicated table's constraint is named
   `uniq_<table>_<field>` instead (no `records_`), so every unique-violation on *any*
   table-per-entity entity (not just WAF's) silently fell back to a bare `409
   {"code":"unique_violation"}` with no field or table named at all. This is what the user saw
   directly in the browser ("lỗi k rõ ràng") and flagged as its own issue.

All 4 fixed in `metap` core (`crates/metap-reconciler/src/{compile,diff}.rs`,
`crates/metap-crud/src/crud_service/{helpers,create,update}.rs`), never worked around here.
Regression-tested there (`compile.rs`/`reconcile_postgres.rs`/`crud_service_postgres.rs` unit +
e2e tests) and verified live: `zones-service` converges to `ops_applied: 0` for every entity
across repeated boots, `waf.zones.hostname`'s uniqueness is enforced again, and a duplicate
`waf.ddos_policies` create now returns `field_errors: {"zoneId": [...]}` instead of a bare code.

**A 5th bug hit live on the portal the same day, after these 4 fixes had already landed**
(2026-09-07, `../metap-docs/docs/roadmap/80-composite-unique-constraints-and-partial-unique-index-fix.md`):
recreating a `DdosPolicy` for a zone whose prior policy had been soft-deleted still failed with
`unique_violation`, because `waf.ddos_policies` on the dev DB was still sitting on the *pre-fix*
blanket `UNIQUE` constraint from before bug #2 above was fixed — bug #2's fix changes what
`compile()` builds for *new* reconciles, it doesn't retroactively convert an index that already
exists. Immediate unblock: deleted the 1 colliding soft-deleted row (user-confirmed). Root-cause
fix: converted `waf.ddos_policies` to the partial unique index bug #2 already describes. **This
surfaced a 6th, still-unresolved gap**: after the `compile()` fix, the old blanket index did not
get replaced by the new partial one through a normal `reconcile()` call — `ops_applied` stayed
nonzero indefinitely on repeated boots, even though the same mechanism converges correctly for a
brand-new entity (e2e-tested). Worked around once with a manual non-concurrent `DROP INDEX IF
EXISTS` (reconcile then converged normally on the next boot); suspected `CREATE INDEX
CONCURRENTLY` leaving state that lets a later `IF NOT EXISTS` silently no-op, but **not
root-caused** — treat as a known gap in the executor-level transition logic, not proof the
mechanism is broken for fresh entities.

**Composite/multi-field unique constraints were also built this same pass** (`EntityDefinition
.unique_constraints`, `metap-metadata`/`metap-reconciler`/`metap-crud`/`metap-lowcode`), prompted
by the user asking what a multi-field case would need (illustrated with a blacklist/whitelist
`(type, value)` example, not a request for a new real entity). **No entity in this repo uses it**
— all `unique: true` fields here (`waf.zones.hostname`, `waf.ddos_policies.zoneId`) stay
single-field; re-confirmed by grepping `unique: Some(true)` across all 9 entities after this pass,
same 2 fields as before, nothing else needs it yet.

**Real data-loss incident during this same migration, worth recording so it isn't repeated**: the
first pass wrongly assumed all 9 entities had 0 rows in `records` (based on "no seed script
exists" + `docs/05-metap-technical-mapping.md`'s stale note, never a direct query) — in fact 2
tenants (`2e87cf98-46a7-473f-bebc-20307e17d3b3`, `9de4259e-dd15-44e2-a0ff-70d323ad0ae9`) had 25
real rows across all 9 entities from live portal testing. Flipping `table_name` + reconciling
empty dedicated tables without copying that data made it invisible through the API (login still
worked — auth is unrelated to entity data — but every list came back empty), reported live by the
user as "login vẫn được nhưng dữ liệu mất". Recovered same session via
`metap_reconciler::migrate_generic_to_dedicated` per (tenant, entity) — row counts now match
`records` exactly for 8 of 9 entities; `waf.ddos_policies` needed a `deleted=false`-only copy
(bug #2 above hadn't been fixed yet at that point in the session) to avoid colliding with its own
soft-deleted history. **Lesson**: any future table-per-entity migration on a table that's had real
traffic must query `records` directly for row counts per (tenant, entity) first — doc claims and
"no seed script" are not a substitute.

**Resolved 2026-09-09** (`../metap-docs/docs/roadmap/82-record-referenced-ux-and-metadata-control-schema-split.md`):
deleting a `Zone` that still has a live `DdosPolicy`/`FirewallRule` stays blocked with
`record_referenced` (confirmed correct, not a bug, since Phase 81) — the user chose to keep the
block rather than cascade-soft-delete, and improve the error's UX instead:
`metap-crud::find_referencing_records` now reports every blocking record (not just the first),
and `../platform-ui`'s `ReferencedByErrorMessage.tsx` renders each as a link straight to the
blocking record, generically for every entity/app that uses the generic delete flow, not a
WAF-specific fix.

**2 more incidents found live 2026-09-12, debugging a "policy created but portal doesn't seem to
reflect it" report** (`waf.ddos_policies`, zone `fb2137d0-d012-4a01-9032-8ad3bed24de1`) — both are
the same *class* of bug as the 6th gap above (a tracking/ledger table says "done", but the actual
database object silently isn't there anymore), just in 2 different places:

**7th: the `pg_trgm` extension itself had silently vanished from the shared dev database**,
despite `_sqlx_migrations` recording migration 16 (`CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm;`) as
applied. `zones-service` failed to boot entirely (`operator class "gin_trgm_ops" does not exist
for access method "gin"`, reconcile can't build the trigram index a `searchable` field needs).
Exactly why the extension disappeared while the ledger still says "applied" is unknown — not
root-caused, same as the 6th gap's own "not root-caused" note. Immediate fix: re-ran `CREATE
EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm;` by hand (idempotent, took effect this time), restarted
`zones-service` — reconciled clean, `ops_applied=1/0/0` across its 3 entities.

**8th, still open: `waf.ddos_policies.zoneId`'s sync trigger had also silently vanished**, and
this one *did* let real duplicate data through. `zoneId` is a `Reference` field — per
`compile.rs`'s doc comment, a `Reference` field with `ref_entity` set gets `ColumnOrigin::Generated`
exactly like an explicit `storage: column` field does, meaning `compile()` intends it to get the
same `BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE` sync trigger (`executor::build_sync_trigger_sql`) keeping the real
column in sync with `data ->> 'zoneId'` — this is not a design gap, `metap-crud`'s `create()`/
`update()` were never supposed to write that column directly, the trigger was. But querying the
live DB found **both the trigger and its backing function gone** (`pg_trigger`/`pg_proc` empty for
`waf_ddos_policies`), while `reconciler_backfill_progress` still has 4 rows marked
`completed = true` for this exact `(table, zoneId)` backfill, dated 2026-09-07/2026-09-08 (from
the original table-per-entity migration and the later `waf` schema-rename pass) — so the trigger
genuinely existed once and was later lost by some means not yet identified. Consequence: every
`createWafDdosPolicies` since then wrote a correct `data->>'zoneId'` (so the portal read the right
value back — this is why it looked like "created, portal doesn't show it" rather than "creation
failed") but left the real `"zoneId"` column `NULL`, and Postgres's own `NULL <> NULL` semantics
mean `uniq_waf_ddos_policies_zoneId ... WHERE deleted = false` **enforces nothing** against a NULL
column — 11 duplicate policies for the same zone got created back to back with zero rejection.
**Why `reconcile()` never re-detects or re-heals this on its own, every boot, `ops_applied=0`
regardless**: `diff.rs`'s convergence check for an *already-existing* `Generated` column only
re-asserts the sync trigger when `introspect()` reports `backfilled: false` — and `introspect()`
derives that flag *purely* from `reconciler_backfill_progress.completed`, never by actually
checking `pg_trigger`/`pg_proc` for the trigger's real presence. Once a row is marked
`completed = true`, nothing in the reconcile loop will ever re-verify the trigger is still there,
so a trigger dropped outside the reconciler's own lifecycle (however that happened here — not
root-caused) becomes a **silent, permanent, self-inflicted-looking gap**: the entity that already
converged once never gets re-checked again. This is the exact same failure shape as the 6th gap
above (blanket→partial unique index never retried) and the 7th (`pg_trgm`) — a real convergence
promise `metap-reconciler` makes ("level-triggered, always resumes from actual state") that
currently only holds for the specific properties `introspect()` actually re-derives from
`pg_catalog` each run, not for anything it instead trusts a bookkeeping table's flag for.

**Immediate unblock — applied, 2026-09-12**: deleted the 10 duplicate NULL-`zoneId` rows (kept the
newest of the original batch), flipped the nil-tenant `reconciler_backfill_progress` row for
`backfill:waf.waf_ddos_policies:zoneId` back to `completed = false`, restarted `zones-service` —
`reconcile()` re-asserted the trigger through the normal mechanism (`ops_applied=2`, confirmed
`trg_sync_waf_ddos_policies_zoneId` + its function both present again). This surfaced the 9th
finding below (the accompanying backfill silently touched 0 rows) — worked around by hand-backfilling
the 1 real surviving row directly, and soft-deleting a duplicate this verification pass itself
created while confirming the fix. Re-verified live end to end afterward: a repeat
`createWafDdosPolicies` for the same zone now correctly returns `409 unique_violation` with
`fieldErrors: {"zoneId": [...]}`, not a silent duplicate.

**Root-cause fix, 3 parts** (docs-first per project owner's request — this section is the plan,
not a changelog of what's done; **update 2026-09-17: items 1 and 3 are now done** —
`../metap-docs/docs/roadmap/84-reconciler-sync-trigger-ledger-drift-fix.md` and
`../metap-docs/docs/roadmap/89-backfill-tenant-scoping-fix.md` respectively. Item 2 remains a
flagged, undecided architecture question):
1. **Close the specific gap**: make `introspect()`'s `ColumnOrigin::Generated` classification (or
   a new check `diff()` runs alongside it) also verify the sync trigger/function actually exist in
   `pg_catalog` (`pg_trigger`/`pg_proc`), not just trust `reconciler_backfill_progress.completed`.
   A `Generated` column whose trigger is missing should read back as `backfilled: false` (or a new,
   more precisely-named state) regardless of what the ledger says, so `diff()`'s existing
   `push_sync_and_backfill` re-assertion path fires on the very next reconcile — no new DDL op type
   needed, just a more honest `actual` read.
2. **Close the general pattern**: the 6th gap, the `pg_trgm` incident, and this one are 3 separate
   instances of "a ledger says done, `introspect()`/migration-runner never re-verifies the real
   object" — worth a project-owner decision on whether `metap-reconciler`'s `introspect()` should
   more broadly re-derive *every* convergence signal from `pg_catalog` directly (no trusted
   ledger at all, more expensive per reconcile) versus keeping ledgers as a performance
   optimization but adding a cheap periodic/best-effort cross-check (e.g. `reconciler-orchestrator`'s
   existing poll loop spot-checking a sample of `Generated` columns' triggers). Flagging, not
   deciding — same "don't resolve unilaterally" convention as the open questions below.
3. **Close the 9th finding below**: `backfill::run_batched_update` needs to accept "backfill every
   tenant's rows in this table", not just one `tenant_id`, for any table reconciled with a
   sentinel/non-owning tenant id (`PLATFORM_TENANT_ID` at a `Schema`-strategy service's own boot,
   same pattern `zones-service`/`scanning-service`/`alerting-service` all use) — either drop the
   `tenant_id` filter entirely for a caller that already knows the table is shared (a new
   `BackfillColumn` variant or parameter), or have `executor.rs` resolve the *real* tenant id set
   to iterate (e.g. `SELECT DISTINCT tenant_id FROM {table}`) before calling
   `run_batched_update` once per real tenant, instead of once with whatever sentinel `reconcile()`
   itself was called with. Whichever direction, `mark_completed` firing after a query that matched
   zero rows for the *wrong reason* (not "already done", but "was never going to find anything")
   needs to stop looking identical to genuine completion — the 8th and 9th together mean a
   `Generated` column on a shared table can pass every convergence check available today
   (`ops_applied=0`, `backfilled=true`) while never actually holding correct data outside whichever
   single tenant id someone happened to reconcile it with by hand.

   **Done 2026-09-17** (`../metap-docs/docs/roadmap/89-backfill-tenant-scoping-fix.md`) — took the
   first direction (drop the filter entirely), not the per-tenant loop: `metap-reconciler` gained
   `BackfillScope::{SingleTenant,AllTenants}`, threaded through new `reconcile_with_scope`/
   `execute_with_scope` (the existing `reconcile()`/`execute()` keep their old signatures,
   defaulting to `SingleTenant`, since `../metap-demo-jira`/`../metap-demo-crm` call `reconcile()`
   directly and a signature break there can't be fixed in the same session). All 3 services below
   now call `reconcile_with_scope(..., BackfillScope::AllTenants)`. Same pass found this wasn't a
   WAF peculiarity: `metap-app::MetapApp::with_entities` (the shared builder `templates/metap-app`/
   `../metap-lowcode` also use) always reconciles with the same sentinel for every entity it
   registers, so it was fixed there too — closes the gap for every service built on that builder,
   not just these 3.

**9th, found while manually unblocking the 8th**: flipping the backfill-progress row and
restarting `zones-service` *did* restore the trigger (confirmed: `trg_sync_waf_ddos_policies_zoneId`
+ its function both back in `pg_catalog`), but the accompanying `BackfillColumn` op reported
success while backfilling **zero** real rows — `146a49e1-...` (the surviving real policy from the
8th's cleanup) still had `"zoneId" IS NULL` immediately after. Root cause:
`backfill::run_batched_update`'s batch query scopes every row it touches by `t.tenant_id = $2`,
and `zones-service`'s own boot-time `reconcile()` call always passes `metap::control::
PLATFORM_TENANT_ID` (`Uuid::nil()`) — a sentinel with zero real rows in a **shared, `Schema`-strategy**
table like `waf.waf_ddos_policies` (many real tenants' zones' policies all live in this one table,
distinguished by their own `tenant_id` column per row — this is not a `DedicatedDb` tenant's own
exclusively-owned table). The backfill batch's `WHERE t.tenant_id = $2` query matches nothing,
the loop exits immediately (`ids.is_empty()`), and `mark_completed` still fires — a real historical
row belonging to any actual tenant can never be reached by a boot-time reconcile's backfill, only
by a reconcile explicitly invoked with that tenant's own id. `run_batched_update`'s own doc comment
already states the assumption this violates: "every dedicated table belongs to exactly one
`DedicatedDb` tenant" — true for `../metap-demo-jira`'s per-tenant dedicated databases, **false**
for every `Schema`-strategy shared table in this repo (all 9 WAF entities). Immediate unblock used
here: hand-run the single-row `UPDATE ... SET "zoneId" = (data->>'zoneId')::uuid WHERE id = ...`
directly (bypassing the batch backfill's broken tenant scoping) for the one surviving real row.
**Fixed at the root 2026-09-17 — see the fix plan below, item 3.**

**Broader audit of `metap-reconciler` for the same failure class, done same day**: checked
`introspect.rs`'s other reads (indexes/FKs/unique constraints — all already re-derived fresh from
`pg_catalog` every call, no ledger trust there), `diff.rs` (compares only against that fresh data),
`watchdog.rs` (no independent cached state, re-derives everything via the next `reconcile()`), and
`orchestrator.rs`'s `reconciler_entity_deployments` (written immediately after a real `reconcile()`
call succeeds in the same call chain — not read back later as a substitute for checking reality, so
no drift window). Found one more instance of the same shape as the 9th finding above, lower risk:
`migrate.rs::copy_generic_records`'s `mark_completed` also fires unconditionally regardless of how
many rows the one-shot copy actually moved — but unlike `run_batched_update`, every current caller
of this specific function always passes a real tenant_id for a real one-shot migration, never the
`PLATFORM_TENANT_ID` sentinel that triggered the 9th finding, so this is a latent defense-in-depth
gap, not a live bug today. No other instances found — the `sync_trigger_exists` fix already shipped
(8th) and the backfill tenant-scoping gap (9th, still open) are the only 2 real instances of this
failure class in this crate.

`entities.waf_*` (all 9 tables) also moved into their own `waf` schema the same pass, out of the
schema shared with `../metap-demo-crm` — `table_name` is `qualified_table_name_in(name, "waf")`
now, not the old shared-`entities` default; see the phase doc and `../metap/CLAUDE.md`'s
`metap-control`/`metap-reconciler` bullets for the full mechanism and the `compile()` bug it
exposed (fixed at the root, not worked around here).

Notable open questions flagged in the docs (don't resolve unilaterally — surface them):
- Whether `FirewallRule.matchCondition` reuses `metap-permission`'s `PolicyCondition` grammar or
  needs its own (request fields like `uri.path`/`header.x`/`body.y` vs. entity fields).
- Whether `Incident` correlation is a static rule or per-tenant configurable threshold.
- `SecurityEvent` retention/archival policy (cold storage via `metap-storage`?) — unaffected by
  the table-per-entity move above, still open.

## v1 scope

Four pillars only — treat anything else as out of scope unless the user says otherwise:
1. **DDoS L7 Protection** (policy per Zone: threshold/sensitivity/action)
2. **WAF / Firewall Rules** (one shared match-condition→action engine for WAF custom rules, rate
   limiting, and IP/geo firewall — deliberately not three separate features)
3. **Vulnerability Scanning** (scheduled/manual scan jobs → findings → remediation tracking)
4. **Analytics + Alerting + Incident management** (required to make the other three pillars provable)

Explicitly out of v1 (documented so it isn't forgotten, not "never"): Bot management, API schema
validation/discovery, managed WAF ruleset (OWASP CRS-style), TLS/certificate management, Page
Shield, Attack Surface Management, L3/L4 DDoS.

## Personas / RBAC

Reuses `metap`'s existing RBAC matrix + ABAC condition builder — no new permission engine, just new
action sets for these entities. Roles: Platform Admin (all tenants), Tenant Admin (full control
within tenant), Security Analyst/SOC (handles Incidents/SecurityEvents, edits rules, can't delete
Zone), Developer (owns ScanFinding remediation only, no DdosPolicy/FirewallRule access), Viewer
(read-only Analytics/Incident).

## Working conventions

- Three independent Cargo workspaces, one per plane — never one workspace spanning them, since a
  shared workspace would mean a portal change rebuilds and redeploys the edge. `cargo
  build/test/clippy --workspace` from `data-plane/`, `control-plane/`, or `edge-plane/`
  separately; `pnpm dev`/`tsc -b`/`oxlint` from `data-plane/web`.
- `edge-plane/` must never gain a `metap` dependency. If something there needs a `metap`
  primitive, that is a signal the work belongs in `control-plane` instead.
- **Phases 70/71 (2026-09-03) and 72 (2026-09-04) landed unverified on purpose, then got a
  dedicated build/test/verify pass the same day (2026-09-04).** `cargo build`/`clippy --all-targets
  -- -D warnings`/`test --workspace` are clean across all 3 Rust workspaces (`data-plane`,
  `control-plane`, `edge-plane`); `data-plane/web` passes `tsc -b`/`oxlint`/`prettier --check`/a
  real `vite build`. That pass found and fixed real bugs — 48 TypeScript errors (every `toast()`
  call site used a shape the design system doesn't have), a clippy error, 6 dead-code warnings —
  and added 80 unit tests for the previously-untested pure logic (`aggregate` SQL planning,
  `compile.rs`'s zone/rule compilation, `evaluate.rs`'s mitigation decision, the rate limiter, the
  clearance cookie).
- **A second pass the same day (2026-09-04) ran the 3 `data-plane` services' own e2e tests against
  a real Postgres for the first time.** Docker Hub image pulls are blocked in this environment by
  an org network policy (403 at the proxy's CONNECT layer, confirmed via `/__agentproxy/status` —
  not retried/bypassed, per that proxy's own instructions), so a native (apt-installed, non-Docker)
  Postgres/RabbitMQ stood in for `docker compose up -d postgres rabbitmq`, matched to that file's
  own `metap`/`metap` credential convention. `zones-service`/`scanning-service`/`alerting-service`'s
  `http_server.rs` `#[ignore]` e2e test (`cargo test -p <service> --test http_server -- --ignored`)
  found and fixed a real bug in all 3: the test minted a JWT and called `POST /api/test.tasks`
  without ever seeding a `user_roles` row for that user, so `PermissionService::check_action`'s
  deny-by-default entity-level check (no matching policy → forbidden) correctly rejected it —
  `201` expected, `403` actual. `metap-http`'s own canonical `http_server.rs` (the template this
  was copied from) seeds `INSERT INTO user_roles (..., 'admin')` before minting its token; this
  repo's copy had dropped that line. Fixed identically in all 3 (seed + matching teardown); all 3
  now pass against live Postgres. `metap` core's own `cargo test --workspace -- --ignored` (run
  the same session, same native Postgres/RabbitMQ) is green across dozens of test files — strong
  evidence the platform primitives Phase 70-72 build on are sound beyond unit-test level. **Still
  not covered**: `control-plane`/`edge-plane` have no live-infra e2e tests of their own yet (their
  test suites are pure-logic unit tests, already green), and there is still no end-to-end proof
  that a rule change on the portal reaches the edge and actually blocks a request — see "Còn lại"
  in `../metap-docs/docs/roadmap/72-control-edge-planes.md` for exactly what that leaves open.
  Full detail on all 3 passes (what shipped unverified, what the first verify pass then found, and
  what this live-Postgres pass found) is in the "Xác minh" / "Đã verify" sections of
  `../metap-docs/docs/roadmap/70-aggregate-api.md`, `71-waf-admin-portal.md`, and
  `72-control-edge-planes.md`.
- Docs are the spec. If an implementation choice isn't settled in `data-plane/docs/`, don't invent
  one silently — it's likely one of the explicitly-flagged open questions above.
- **Auth moved from a shared static RSA keypair to `metap-jwks` (Ed25519, 2026-09-04).** The 3
  `data-plane` services + `graphql-gateway` used to share 1 `dev-jwt-private.pem` file (copied
  into every container) for both mint and verify. They now default to a `metap-jwks` trust root
  instead — `zones-service` publishes `/.well-known/jwks.json`, every service (including
  `zones-service` itself) verifies via `JWKS_URL`, and `graphql-gateway` verifies the same way
  (no private key file needed there at all now). This was additive/opt-in work in `metap` core
  (`metap-http::AppState.token_verifier`/`token_signer`, `metap-jwks::{TokenVerifier,
  TokenSigner}`, `dev-tools gen-jwks-key`) — `metap-demo-crm`/`metap-demo-jira`/`metap-lowcode`
  are unaffected, verified by building them unchanged. **Scope deliberately stopped short of a
  single-issuer topology**: all 3 services still hold the same private key locally (mint
  themselves), matching the old RSA topology's blast radius — only rotation got safer (`JwksKeyStore`'s
  3-step add/promote/retire), not the "1 process holds the only private key" property JWKS
  otherwise enables. See `data-plane/README.md`'s GraphQL gateway section for the auth-flow
  detail and the 3 services' own `.env.example` for the exact env vars
  (`JWKS_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH`/`JWKS_KID_PATH`/`JWKS_URL`). RSA (`AUTH_JWT_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH`/
  `AUTH_JWT_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH`, `dev-tools gen-keys`) still works as an explicit fallback if the
  JWKS env vars are unset.
