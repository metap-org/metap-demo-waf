// The Customer Portal backend is 3 separate services since the pillar split (2026-09-01, see
// ../README.md's service/port table) — no single origin serves every `waf.*` entity anymore.
// `targetForEntity` (below) picks the right one per request based on the entity name in the
// URL, the same "route by entity prefix" scheme `../README.md`/`../docs/61-*` describe for a
// real deployment's Traefik rules; here it's inlined into a hand-rolled dev-server middleware
// instead, since there's no Traefik in front of this dev server. **Not Vite's built-in
// `server.proxy`'s `router` option** — tried that first, found live it silently always resolved
// to the object's own static `target` regardless of what `router` returned (Vite 8's proxy
// internals didn't behave the way older Vite/`http-proxy` docs describe); a plain `fetch`-based
// forward here is simpler to get right than debugging that further.
// Env-overridable (default unchanged: plain `pnpm dev` on the host still hits `localhost`) so
// `../docker-compose.dev.yml`'s `web` service can point these at the pillar containers' own
// service DNS names (`http://zones-service:3000`, ...) instead — lets that container use normal
// bridge networking + port-mapped `ports:` rather than `network_mode: host`.
