// SecurityEvent retention cleanup — the one piece of the decided-but-unbuilt v1 retention policy
// (data-plane/docs/02-domain-model.md's "Chốt tiếp (2026-08-30)" section): "30 ngày mặc định...
// Không build cơ chế archive S3 thật ở v1 — hết hạn thì xoá (dùng metap-cron Schedule job dọn
// định kỳ)". The Plan-tier override (`accessLogRetentionDays`-style, per
// data-plane/docs/12-billing-plans.md) stays undone along with the rest of billing/Plan, which
// has no entity or code anywhere in this product yet — this ships the flat 30-day default the
// doc already names as the fallback, not a per-tenant variant of something that doesn't exist.
