// Package proxy passes an allowed request through to the customer's origin.
//
// Scope, stated plainly: this is a reverse proxy adequate for a mitigation demo, not a
// production CDN edge. It does not do connection pooling per origin beyond what net/http's
// default Transport gives it, TLS to the origin is plain http unless the origin address says
// otherwise, and it buffers request bodies rather than streaming them. Those are real
// limitations, listed here rather than discovered later.
//
// What it does get right, because getting them wrong would be a security bug rather than a
// performance one:
//   - hop-by-hop headers are stripped (RFC 9110 §7.6.1), so Connection/Upgrade from a client
//     cannot leak into the origin request;
//   - X-Forwarded-For is SET, not appended to whatever the client sent — a client-supplied
//     X-Forwarded-For reaching the origin would let anyone forge their own source address for
//     every downstream system that trusts that header;
//   - the origin's own hop-by-hop headers are stripped on the way back.
